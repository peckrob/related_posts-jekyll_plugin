= related_posts

This is a {jekyll}[http://jekyllrb.com/] plugin that overrides the built in
related_posts function to calculate related posts based on a posts' 
categories. This was forked from the original repo that uses tags.

== Installation
To register it as a plugin, copy <tt>_plugins/related_posts.rb</tt> to the
<tt>_plugins</tt> directory of your jekyll project.

== How to use it
The plugin replaces the functionality of <tt>site.related_posts</tt> so you
can use it as follows:
  {% for post in site.related_posts %}
    <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a><br />
  {% endfor %}
